### Hi

- currently working on : minCPT, signal-thing
- currently learning : bunch of stuff including quantum computing, EE, and radio design

## projects:
- [minCPT](https://github.com/yasserhcn/MinCPT) : minimalist alternative to cmake, I guess it's done unless I get other idea
- [signal-thing](https://github.com/yasserhcn/sig-analysis) : c++ program to analyse signals from SDRs, working on it when I'm not busy with uni
